## What CARE-IT Is

CARE-IT provides a structured framework for the design, governance, 
operation and evolution of clinically relevant digital systems.

It integrates:

- Clinical effectiveness as primary objective
- System-level thinking across interconnected devices and platforms
- Transparent responsibility allocation
- Patient safety as normative boundary
- Lifecycle-oriented operational sustainability
- Information integrity as clinical foundation
- Controlled innovation from an operator perspective

CARE-IT does not replace regulatory frameworks or established IT service management models.
It provides a clinically understandable governance layer that aligns digital infrastructure
with patient care reality.
